## Introduction

Quick project of a self driving car using JavaScript.

## Features

1. Self-Driving Car Simulation: self-driving car driving and avoiding other vehicles
2. Sensor Simulation: Simulate sensors on the car using raycasting to detect proximity to the road's edge or other cars in traffic.
3. Collision Detection: using segment intersection formulas, supporting various orientations and shapes.
4. Neural Network Visualization: inspired by biological neural networks, optimizing them through trial and error.
5. Genetic Algorithm Optimization: Optimize neural networks using a basic genetic algorithm, parallelizing the process to save time.

## Installation

clone the the project then run locally, i used Live Server extension.
